# Weather App Interview Guide

## Project Introduction
"I developed a modern weather application using React and Redux that provides real-time weather information and forecasts. The app features a clean, intuitive interface and uses industry-standard APIs."

## Key Technical Highlights

### 1. Architecture Decisions
- "I chose React for its robust ecosystem and component-based architecture"
- "Redux manages global state, making data flow predictable and maintainable"
- "Chakra UI provides consistent, accessible components"

### 2. Feature Implementation
- Location Detection:
  "I implemented geolocation using the browser's Navigator API, with proper error handling for user permissions"

- Weather Data:
  "The app fetches data from OpenWeatherMap API, using Redux Thunk for async operations"

- Interactive Map:
  "Integrated Google Maps API for visual location representation"

### 3. Technical Challenges
- State Management:
  "Implemented session storage to persist data and reduce API calls"

- Error Handling:
  "Created a comprehensive error boundary system with user-friendly notifications"

- Performance:
  "Optimized re-renders using Redux selectors and React.memo"

### 4. Code Quality
- "Followed component composition patterns"
- "Implemented proper TypeScript types"
- "Used consistent code style and documentation"

## Common Interview Questions

1. "Why did you choose Redux over Context API?"
   - "Redux offers better performance for complex state"
   - "Dev tools for debugging"
   - "Middleware support for async operations"

2. "How did you handle API errors?"
   - "Implemented try-catch blocks"
   - "User-friendly error messages"
   - "Fallback UI components"

3. "How would you scale this application?"
   - "Implement caching strategy"
   - "Add PWA capabilities"
   - "Server-side rendering"

4. "What would you improve?"
   - "Add unit tests"
   - "Implement weather alerts"
   - "Add more weather data visualization"
